# Blood-Bank-Database-Management
My project is based on a database of a blood bank within my hometown (Maamoura/Nabeul). It contains 5 tables  containing a maximum of 9 attributes each. It stores data about the donors, patients and white coats (doctors and  nurses) by their IDs within that same blood bank.
